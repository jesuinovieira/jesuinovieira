# Hey, I'm Jesuino ðŸ‘‹

With nearly 5 years of experience as a **data scientist** and **software developer** at [IconPro GmbH](https://iconpro.com/en/), Iâ€™m now applying for a Masterâ€™s program to further expand my expertise. My research interests lie in the **interdisciplinary applications** of data science, particularly in **bioinformatics** and **neuroscience**, where I strive to learn and develop techniques for the benefit of all.
